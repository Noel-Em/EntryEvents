## Introduction

EntryEvents is an event-driven system for JavaScript and TypeScript for handling custom events and listeners, designed to simplify event handling.<br>
It is crafted with simplicity and usability in mind, making it ideal for applications where event handling is needed without the complexity of heavy frameworks.

### Why choose EntryEvents?

- **Zero Dependencies:** EntryEvents doesnâ€™t require any external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into any TypeScript project.

- **Asynchronous Event Support:** Emit and listen to events asynchronously using ```asemit```, ensuring compatibility with asynchronous code.

- **Event Overriding Control:** Easily control whether to override existing event listeners with the override flag when registering events.

- **Global and Instance-based Event Management:** EntryEvents provides both static (global) and instance-based event management, allowing flexibility depending on the scope of your application.

});

console.log(GEntry.emit("tell", "Welcome on EntryEvents"));

const e = new Entry();
e.once('tell', (message: string) => {
    return "Local Entry tells: " + message;
});

console.log( e.emit("tell", "Here's a little example on how to use it") );
